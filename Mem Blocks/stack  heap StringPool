Stack 
primitive data , reference to obj on Heap , method memory blocks for each method , temp vars 
can have multiple stacks in a application -> each thread has its own  stack 


{
As the scope or block ends and work is done , Scopes will be popped

} //block ends

---------


Heap  ( string pool is also here ) 
stores obj 

------



GC 
checks if a obj is reference on stack > no > eligible for GC

Strong ref -> new User(); 

Weak ref ->  new WeakReference<User> ( new User ( x ,y ) ) ;  -> as soon as gc runs > removed

soft ref -> only remove if very urgent or inder memory pressure 

Change ref >  set to null , or point to something else


Parts of heap
> young gen  > less age > low freq uses 
> old gen > above thres age , more often used object
> metaspace > classes are loaded here when needed ( constants, static etc, defination ) 

Versions 
Serial  1 thread
parallel mX thread , low pause 
Concurrent Mark Sweep -> low pause time , works with application threads , no compaction
G1  -> better than above + compaction
